## Gameplay
**Castle Rush** is a tower defense game where the player does not control the defenses, but the attackers. You must get past as many defenses as possible in order to capture the maximum number of castles.
Upgrade your troops and spells to create an attack strategy for each new map. Each map is independent and procedurally generated.
